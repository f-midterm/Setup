# --- Database Configuration for TESTS ONLY ---
# Why: This file overrides the main properties during the test phase.
# Spring Boot automatically picks it up because src/test/resources is prioritized during testing.
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:h2:mem:testdb
spring.datasource.driverClassName=org.h2.Driver
spring.datasource.username=sa
spring.datasource.password=password

# Why: 'create-drop' ensures a clean, predictable database for every test run.
# The database is created before the tests start and completely wiped after they finish.
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=create-drop

# Why: Showing SQL in test logs is useful for debugging test failures.
spring.jpa.show-sql=true
